# Reporting issues / asking questions - READ THIS FIRST BEFORE REPORTING AN ISSUE

I am really glad when I receive feedback and questions from you guys because this means my articles are interesting and
useful. After all I am doing this for you as I really love teaching :).

Quite often I receive questions on how to extend some solution
further or fix some kind of an error. I'm trying to be as helpful as possible but please help me a bit as well. So, when sending
me a question via e-mail or when reporting an issue here on GitHub:

* **Specify which article are we talking about.**
* If you need help with an error, **provide that error**! This seems obvious but sometimes people just forget to do so.
* Error stack trace is always very much welcome.
* If possible, list some pieces of relevant code or provide a link to the GitHub repo if your project is open source.
If, for some reason, you can't reveal your code (due to privacy policies, for example) - that's okay, we'll deal with this
somehow.
* Try to overcome the problem yourself before contacting me and list the solutions you've already tried. Still, if you have
absolutely no clue of what to do - go ahead and write me right away.
* If you are reporting an issue on GitHub, write in English because other people might experience the same problem. I am able to understand some other languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish), well, at some basic level at least, but still English is preferred.
* If you want me to cover a specific topic, try to provide some exact details on what has to be covered. Articles can't be too
long and therefore topics like "how to write automated tests" or "how to write cool Rails apps" aren't suitable. There are
many good books about Ruby and Rails in general out there :).
