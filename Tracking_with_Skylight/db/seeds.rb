# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 50.times do
#   album = Album.create({title: Faker::Book.title, musician: Faker::StarWars.character})
#   30.times do
#     album.songs.create({title: Faker::Book.title, duration: rand(500)})
#   end
# end

#Album.all.shuffle.take(20).each {|a| a.toggle!(:published)}
